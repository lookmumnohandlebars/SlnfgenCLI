### üéâ A tool for managing monorepos with automated solution filter generation üéâ

---

</div>

### ‚ùì What Is It?

A CLI, or dotnet tool, that extends the .NET solution tooling with automated solution filter generation from a manifest file.

Made with love by @lookmumnohandlebars

### ‚ùì Why Would You Use It?

If you've ever had a monolith, or distributed system, with multiple applications and services, you'll know the pain of keeping a single solution organised and loadable by an IDE! Solution Filters were developed by the Visual Studio team to support this, however they become difficult to maintain.

- **Mono-repo tooling**: Allows automated maintenance of a .NET monorepo - similar to NX!
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Linux & Mac!
- **Built with MSBuild**: Uses the same engine that Visual Studio and Rider uses to load solutions!

## üì¶ Installation

### Local (recommended)

To install local to a repository, [setup a tool-manifest file](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/local-tools-how-to-use#create-a-manifest-file). To automatically add Slnfgen.CLI to the manifest

```bash
dotnet tool install Slnfgen.CLI
```

This can then be run as:

```
dotnet tool run slnfgen
```

### Global

To install globally:

```bash
dotnet tool install Slnfgen.CLI -g
```

This can then be run as:

```bash
dotnet slfgen
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

### Manifest File

The Manifest File is used to define all solution filters for a given solution. Both JSON and YAML file formats are supported (the schema can be found [here](./schema/manifest-file.schema.json))

Here is an example Manifest File:

```yml
solutionFile: Contoso.slnx # sln & slnx supported
autoIncludeSuffixPatterns:
  - Tests
filterDefinitions:
  - name: ContosoProducts # becomes FilterOne.slnf
    entrypoints:
      - Contoso.Products/Contoso.Products.csproj
      - Contoso.Products.Tests/Contoso.Products.Tests.csproj
    autoIncludeSuffixPatterns: Benchmarks

  - name: ContosoPayments
    entrypoints:
      - Payments/Contoso.Payments/Payments.csproj
      - tests/Contoso.Payments.Tests/Contoso.Payments.Tests.csproj
```

- `solutionFile`: The path to the "Parent" solution file
- `filterDefinitions`: Each filter is defined by a `name` (the name of the Solution Filter), and `entryPoints` which are projects at the top of the dependency tree (usually these will be the deployed projects and test projects)
- `autoIncludeSuffixPatterns`: These are the suffix patterns to automatically include in the solution filter. Primarily

### Generating Filters

With a valid Manifest file, the CLI can then be executed to generate the declared solution filters

```bash
# Generate all solution filters defined in the manifest.yml file
slfngen all manifest.yml

# Generate only the MyFilter solution filter in the manifest.yml file
slnfgen target manifest.yml -t MyFilter
```
